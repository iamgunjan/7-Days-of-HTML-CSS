# 7-Days-of-HTML-CSS
7 Days of HTML &amp; CSS. Here I will be learning and uploading my work for a week and will be learning HTML &amp; CSS.

The thing about HTML is to keep practicing, always close your tags right after you open them makes it easier not to forget, leaving unclosed tags might cause your website to deform. You can use w3c validator to check your code for errors, miss used tags or unsupported tags. this will also tell you if a tag is deprecated and no longer used, or isn't compatible with all browsers. Once you accomplish this, everything is going to become really simple.
